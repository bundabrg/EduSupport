## Quick Start

1. Make sure you are running a build of Geyser that supports native extensions. You can find a prebuilt one [here](https://github.com/bundabrg/Geyser/releases).

2. Down the latest [GeyserReversion](https://github.com/bundabrg/GeyserReversion/releases) and place it inside your Geyser extensions folder. Note this is
a folder 'extensions' underneath your Geyser folder. If you are running a extension version of Geyser (Spigot/Bungeecord/Velocity)  then
make sure to place it inside the `extensions/Geyser/extensions` folder. Standalone verison of Geyser will be a `extensions` folder
where your Geyser.jar file is located.

3. Start Geyser. It should show some indication that GeyserReversion is running. For example:

```
[11:08:37 INFO] {GeyserReversion} EducationServer listening on /0.0.0.0:19133
[11:08:37 DEBUG] {GeyserReversion} Registered Translator: Translator_v390ee_to_v408be
```

 4. If using `education` you will need to generate a token for each tenancy that you support otherwise you'll get a 
 "School not allowed" error. See [education docs](https://bundabrg.github.io/GeyserReversion/education/) for more info
